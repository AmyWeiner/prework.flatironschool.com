            <h1>iOS Development</h1>

<p>This list comes from keeping track of what has been useful and not useful from
the past few years of learning iOS on my own. I&#39;m compiling this to be a sort
of reference guide for the students in my upcoming class at <a href="http://flatironschool.com/iOScurriculum.html" title="Flatiron School iOS Curriculum">The Flatiron School</a>.</p>

<p>This is meant to get you up to speed with development from no prior iOS
experience. None of this covers the basics of computing/development though. </p>

<p>Students learn in a plethora of ways. If you are an auditory learner there is 
also a ton of great video content from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/coding-together-developing/id593208016" title="Stanford iTunes U Link">Stanford</a> but the progression is pretty obvious so I didn&#39;t create a guide for
that. I HIGHLY recommend the Stanford class.</p>

<p>There is an infinite amount of stuff to learn on iOS. This is a list of what
I&#39;ve found to be the most important for almost every app out there. A secondary
goal of this prework is to limit the scope of learning before you get started.
There really is nothing better than just writing a ton of code. Hopefully this
list of resources can get you to writing code quickly.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>This guide is separated out into the different big topics of iOS development.
I am including advanced topics here mostly for completeness and for reference
down the line. </p>

<p>If you currently know very little, start with the beginner section and do
all the topics. This should get you up to speed with iOS development and really
I would just start writing code! Don&#39;t start looking into the advanced topics
until you find a topic you <em>need</em> to learn.</p>

<p>The Advanced and Referece/Library sections are for you to use once your feel
comfortable with your skills. I really recommend completing all the beginner 
materials before moving on to the advanced resources though. Once you look into
developing apps that require the topics you can return here and find out more
information and hopefully some links to start your research with.</p>

<p>Also, each section contains a description of an example app you should be able
to make. Feel free to try and make the app with the skills you have. If you
have issues with making the app, raise an issue. Hopefully someone will help
you out :)</p>

<p>Last, the Learning Objectives are what I expect you to understand after reading
the beginner materials. Remember the advanced materials are just for deep dives
into topics!</p>

<h3>Flatiron School Students</h3>

<p>Flatiron School Students, your job is to go through each section until the
Advanced iOS work. The Advanced iOS section at the end is if you
are really interested and want to keep learning, but isn&#39;t required. Don&#39;t
worry about the reference or library items. These are all things we will
discuss and use in class. If you already have prior knowledge feel free to skip sections you
feel comfortable with. The best way to learn is through writing a lot of code.
While the ToDo list app I mention isn&#39;t required, I&#39;d <em>highly</em> recommend trying
to write it.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>I tried to use as many free resources as possible but ultimately you have to
spend some money. You&#39;ll need to purchase <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-iOS-Development-Hands--Fundamentals/dp/0321862961/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387385220&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=learning+ios+development">Learning iOS Development: A Hands-on
Guide to the Fundamentals of iOS Programming</a>
 for a few of the items in this guide. It&#39;s an incredible book and it has been
updated for iOS 7/Xcode 5.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<h3>Breadth of Familiarity</h3>

<p>This list of resources will not make you an expert by any means. The goal for
this guide is breadth of knowledge over depth in any one topic. If you are
particularly interested in a topic, feel free to check out the advanced
resources and reference material. </p>

<p>The best way to learn this stuff is still to just write a ton of code. In
addition to checking out the advanced material on a certain topic, coding up
the example apps is a great way to get a deeper understanding.</p>

<h3>Minimum Viable Knowledge</h3>

<p>Learning the topics in the order given allows you to start writing apps as soon
as possible. That&#39;s the fun stuff, so I didn&#39;t want you to have to read for
hours before getting your hands dirty. The goal is layers of quality. After the
first section you will be able to write simple apps. Every new topic you learn
will give you real skills to enhance your app. This means that if you are
struggling with one topic it may be prudent to stay in that one topic and learn
more. If you find other resources that helped you learn please raise and issue
and I&#39;ll include it.</p>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>

<p>If you are confused on a topic, I doubt you&#39;re alone. </p>

<p>Thankfully, there are a few resources available to you.
The easiest is using the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios" title="StackOverflow iOS
tagged homepage">iOS section on
StackOverflow</a>. If the question is about a certain resource here, or about
this guide in general please please please raise an issue on github. I&#39;ll look
into it and hopefully give you a solution that everyone can use.</p>

<h1>The Basics</h1>

<h2>The Command Line</h2>

<p><em>Min 2hr Max 6hr</em></p>

<p>The command line is your home base. It&#39;s probably one of the most important
differences between a consumer of a computer, and a user. Many developers have
all sorts of crazy short cut keys set up so that they can use their computer
solely from the command line without ever having to reach for the mouse. It&#39;s
vitaly important that you start thinking like a developer, rather than a
consumer. Getting comfortable with the command line is the first step. If you
feel like you&#39;re spending too much time on this section, and you&#39;ve
accomplished the learning objectives, move on.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Navigate a file structure</li>
<li>Use your terminal to type commands</li>
<li>Make files and directories from the command line</li>
<li>Open files from the command line</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations-2" title="Console Foundation Treehouse Link">Console Foundations</a> is a great video series by Treehouse that
covers lots of Bash Stuff. Some of it is more advanced, so we only included a
few sections we feel are crucial. But feel free to skip around. The stuff about
Environment Variables and PATHS is important. But it&#39;s short and worth going
through at least once.</p>

<h4>WAT?</h4>

<p>What is version control?!</p>

<p>from Github&#39;s &quot;About Version Control&quot; Version control is a system that records
changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific
versions later. Even though the examples in this book show software source code
as the files under version control, in reality any type of file on a computer
can be placed under version control.</p>

<h1>iOS Fundamentals</h1>

<h2>Objective-C</h2>

<p>Objective-C is the language of iOS and it is most likely pretty different than
what you&#39;ve done before. To get started you just need a bit of knowledge of
Objective-C, but to really master iOS development you need to get a solid
understanding of the language. The best Rails developers are also the best Ruby
developers. The same is true in the Objective-C/iOS world.</p>

<h3>App</h3>

<h2>Object Oriented Principles</h2>

<p>The iOS ecosystem relies heavily on a few Object Orientated principles. The
beginner items covers the stuff that is somewhat unique to iOS. Going further
you will see these patterns <em>everywhere</em>. </p>

<h3>App</h3>

<p>This is mostly a theory section. Just make sure you fully understand the
concepts.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Understand the Delegate pattern</li>
<li>Understand the protocol pattern</li>

</ul>

<h2>Common UI Tools</h2>

<p>iOS comes with a bunch of common UI objects that get you going quickly. As you
learn about things such as <code>UINavigationController</code> and <code>UITableView</code> you&#39;ll
realize that nearly <em>every</em> app utilizes modifications on these simple UI
controls. Let&#39;s learn these!</p>

<h3>App</h3>

<p>Implement your ToDo List app as a UITableView and tapping on each itme should
go to a detail view in the nav controller</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Understand what pushing a ViewController means</li>
<li>Working with <code>UITableViewDataSource</code> methods</li>
<li>Working with UITableviews Dynamically and Statically</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Still based of of iOS 6 but <em>very</em> relevant</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Dive Deeper</h1>

<h2>Core Location/MapKit</h2>

<p>One of the biggest reasons mobile is such an interesting platform is the
ability to use location information. Think how much worse your phone would be
without Google Maps, Yelp, Foursquare, etc. Integrating Core Location is
actually quite easy.</p>

<p>After you learn how to use CoreLocation you need to learn how to present that
data with MapKit. MapKit allows integrated maps into your app. The advanced
section gives you some resources to use Google Maps instead of Apple Maps for
your integrated map views. Google Maps has some interesting features such as
Street View support, but it&#39;s very much icing on the cake. Nobody will complain
if you just use the standard MapKit.</p>

<h3>App</h3>

<p>Add the ability to tag a todo with where it should be completed. Like Buy
groceries at the grocery store.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use the delegate pattern to receive updates from Core Location</li>
<li>Drop pins on a MapKit View</li>
<li>Basic MapKit customizatiosn such as switching between satellite and map
view.</li>
<li>Handle the different events of Core Location such as major change, best
accuracy change, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<h2>Customizing UIKit</h2>

<p>AutoLayout is the new way of defining how your layouts work based on different
rotations and screen sizes. You are lucky because you will learn AutoLayout from
the very beginning but sadly The Big Nerd Ranch book doesn&#39;t include information on AutoLayout because it&#39;s
an iOS 5 book. I&#39;ve included supplementary AutoLayout tutorials because of the
lack of information in the Big Nerd Ranch book.</p>

<p>Learning how to customize your app&#39;s UI is what separates the good apps from
the great. Think about all of the apps you use. Do any of them use the standard
UI elements? Nope. I bet you barely know what the standard iOS controls look
like. If you&#39;re interested open up the settings or contacts app.</p>

<p>This is a huge topic and much of what you&#39;ll do has been done by others and
answered on StackOverflow. After you&#39;ve read this information and have specific
questions search on StackOverflow for answers. Very rarely are you doing
something completely unique.</p>

<h3>App</h3>

<p>Go ahead and customize your app. Change the tint color, maybe add some custom
buttons!</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Be able to style the color/size of major UITableView,UINavigationView and
UITabBar</li>
<li>Understand how Views interact with View Controllers</li>
<li>Understand the View lifecycle</li>

<h1>Advanced iOS</h1>

<h2>APIs and Social Media</h2>

<p>Nothing exists in a vacuum. Apps are expected to share effortlessly and backup
to the cloud. The beginner section has some of the super simple stuff and is
all you really need to get started. The <a href="http://helios.io/" title="Helios Home
Page">Helios</a> tutorial shows you how to create a <em>super simple</em> server side backend
for your iOS app. This is really the absolute simlpest possible solution to
  syncing your app with the internet</p>

<p>I&#39;m purposefully exposing you to the native iOS SDK networking stack before
AFNetworking and the other libraries. It&#39;s <em>very</em> hard to debug problems with
the libraries if you don&#39;t understand the underlying technologies.</p>

<p>Also this has an intermediate section just because this topic is so massive.
Still stick to the beginner information at first though.</p>

<h3>App</h3>

<p>Add server side syncing to your ToDo list app. Also try and share todos on
Twitter/facebook</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ability to set up and use Helios</li>
<li>Understand SLComposeViewController</li>
</ul>

<h2>Core Data</h2>

<p>Core Data is a persistent data store. It is not a database. This is seriously
one of the most confusing technologies in the iOS ecosystem, but it is
something <em>you must learn</em>. In the integrating with APIs section you&#39;ll learn
even more about Core Data and how to save both locally and sync up to the
cloud. Think about all of the apps you use. Most of them can be boiled to down
to displaying some data that is synced to a service.</p>

<h3>App</h3>

<p>Try and save your ToDos locally using Core Data. </p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Understand how read and write data from the NSManagedObjectContext</li>
<li>Persistant CoreData to the device using sqlite3</li>
<li>Work with CoreData with TableViews</li>
<li>Autogenerate, and extend CoreData Model files
16 is great for this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>The iPhone/iPad have a pretty cool set of hardware. Let your creativity flow
with the different hardware features. This is completely different then what
you&#39;ve done on a computer.</p>

<h3>App</h3>

<p>Add the ability to add pictures to your app.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use the camera</li>
<li>Change hardware behavior based on hardware availability</li>
<li>Use the accelerometer and gyro</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://nscookbook.com/2013/03/ios-programming-recipe-19-using-core-motion-to-access-gyro-and-accelerometer/" title="iOS Programming Recipe 19: Using Core Motion to Access Gyro and Accelerometer">Using Core Motion to Access Gyro and Accelerometer</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Core Animation</h3>

<p>Core Animation allows you to access to graphics card to some awesome animations
and transformations without sacrificing speed. The graphics card was designed
to do this and it does a great job. With that great power comes great
responsibility though. iPhone and iPad users expect fluid animations.
Thankfully, many standard animations you are used to seeing are actually built
into the iOS SDK and are super easy to integrate.</p>

<h3>App</h3>

<p>Add in some custom animations. Maybe have a cool strike out animation when you
mark a task as done.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Understand how the contexts and layers of core animation work</li>
<li>Know when to use the correct transitions for different interactions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced</h3>
