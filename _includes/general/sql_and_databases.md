## SQL & Databases
*Min 4hr Max 10hr*

In order for a web application to be useful it needs to store data, access that
data and organize the data. This is the job of a database. Typically web apps
respond to user input and do one of four things, create, read, update, or
delete data in a database. Ruby serves as a kind of intermediary between the
user and the database and Ruby can communicate with a database in its native
language, which for our purposes is SQL.

### Learning Objectives
  1. Understand what a database is used for
  2. Be able to create, read, update and delete data
  3. Understand how you can relate two tables in a database (ex. products and categories)
  4. Be able to write a simple SQL join between two tables

The Treehouse SQL course is comprehensive and easy to follow. It uses MySQL,
which is a powerful database server that we don't really use at Flatiron for
teaching purposes, but learning how to install it and use its GUI isn't a waste
of time. So feel free to gloss over the MySQL setup / specific stuff, but it's
useful.

### [ZetCode SQL Course](http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/)

A more technical introduction to SQL through SQLite3 and the Terminal. It's
short and intense, but try to get through the entire thing. A nice bonus is if
you want to start playing with SQLite and Ruby, go through the other [Zetcode
SQLite and Ruby](http://zetcode.com/db/sqliteruby/) tutorial.
