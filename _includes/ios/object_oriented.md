## Object Oriented Principles

The iOS ecosystem relies heavily on a few Object Orientated principles. The
beginner items covers the stuff that is somewhat unique to iOS. Going further
you will see these patterns *everywhere*. 

### App
This is mostly a theory section. Just make sure you fully understand the
concepts.

### Learning Objectives
  - Understand the Delegate pattern
  - Understand the protocol pattern

### Tasks

  - [iOS Design Patterns:
    Delegation](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/ios-design-patterns-delegation-part-2-2)
      - Learn the Delegation Pattern. This is used all over the place in iOS.
        For example Core Location, TableViews, MapKit, etc.
  - [Intro to
    Protocols](http://iosdevelopertips.com/cocoa/introduction-to-protocols.html "Intro to Protocols")
