## APIs and Social Media

Nothing exists in a vacuum. Apps are expected to share effortlessly and backup
to the cloud. The beginner section has some of the super simple stuff and is
all you really need to get started. The [Helios](http://helios.io/ "Helios Home
Page") tutorial shows you how to create a *super simple* server side backend
for your iOS app. This is really the absolute simlpest possible solution to
  syncing your app with the internet

I'm purposefully exposing you to the native iOS SDK networking stack before
AFNetworking and the other libraries. It's *very* hard to debug problems with
the libraries if you don't understand the underlying technologies.

Also this has an intermediate section just because this topic is so massive.
Still stick to the beginner information at first though.

### App

Twitter/facebook
