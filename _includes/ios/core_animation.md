### Core Animation

Core Animation allows you to access to graphics card to some awesome animations
and transformations without sacrificing speed. The graphics card was designed
to do this and it does a great job. With that great power comes great
responsibility though. iPhone and iPad users expect fluid animations.
Thankfully, many standard animations you are used to seeing are actually built
into the iOS SDK and are super easy to integrate.
