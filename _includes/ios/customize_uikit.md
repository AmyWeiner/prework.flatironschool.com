## Customizing UIKit

AutoLayout is the new way of defining how your layouts work based on different
rotations and screen sizes. You are lucky because you will learn AutoLayout from
the very beginning but sadly The Big Nerd Ranch book doesn't include information on AutoLayout because it's
an iOS 5 book. I've included supplementary AutoLayout tutorials because of the
lack of information in the Big Nerd Ranch book.

Learning how to customize your app's UI is what separates the good apps from
the great. Think about all of the apps you use. Do any of them use the standard
UI elements? Nope. I bet you barely know what the standard iOS controls look
like. If you're interested open up the settings or contacts app.

This is a huge topic and much of what you'll do has been done by others and
answered on StackOverflow. After you've read this information and have specific
questions search on StackOverflow for answers. Very rarely are you doing
something completely unique.
