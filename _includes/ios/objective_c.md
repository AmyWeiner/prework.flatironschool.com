## Objective-C

Objective-C is the language of iOS and it is most likely pretty different than
what you've done before. To get started you just need a bit of knowledge of
Objective-C, but to really master iOS development you need to get a solid
understanding of the language. The best Rails developers are also the best Ruby
developers. The same is true in the Objective-C/iOS world.
