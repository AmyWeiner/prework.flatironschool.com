## Core Location/MapKit

One of the biggest reasons mobile is such an interesting platform is the
ability to use location information. Think how much worse your phone would be
without Google Maps, Yelp, Foursquare, etc. Integrating Core Location is
actually quite easy.

After you learn how to use CoreLocation you need to learn how to present that
data with MapKit. MapKit allows integrated maps into your app. The advanced
section gives you some resources to use Google Maps instead of Apple Maps for
your integrated map views. Google Maps has some interesting features such as
Street View support, but it's very much icing on the cake. Nobody will complain
if you just use the standard MapKit.

###App
Add the ability to tag a todo with where it should be completed. Like Buy
groceries at the grocery store.
